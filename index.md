## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/you.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> Hi, I'm Sopiko - a masterâ€™s student at the University of Helsinki, majoring in Language Technology, Linguistic Diversity and Digital Humanities within the Faculty of Arts. Alongside my studies, I work full-time as an AI Engineer.

My interests span across multiple areas of artificial intelligence, from natural language processing to broader machine learning applications. Outside of tech, I occasionally challenge myself with new activities: my short-lived karate journey taught me that balance is key, both literally and figuratively. These days, I find running to be a refreshing way to reset, and when time allows, I unwind by playing bass guitar.
